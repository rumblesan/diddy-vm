Diddy VM
========

The Diddy VM is a project so I can learn more about writing virtual machines. It's not necessarily going to be the greatest piece of code ever but hopefully it should teach me a bunch of stuff.

Aim
---

The plan is to build a simple VM in python that uses a minimal instruction set as an initial project. Eventually I'm aiming to have this VM rewritten in C and to build a basic compiler for a higher level language.
